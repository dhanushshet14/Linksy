## Setting up shadcn UI

The error you encountered was because you were trying to run the shadcn initialization command from the root directory, but your Next.js application is located in the `my-app` subdirectory.

### Option 1: Use the provided scripts

For your convenience, two scripts have been created to help you set up shadcn UI:

1. **PowerShell Script** (Recommended for Windows users):
   ```
   .\setup-shadcn.ps1
   ```

2. **Batch File**:
   ```
   setup-shadcn.bat
   ```

Both scripts will:
- Navigate to the `my-app` directory
- Run the shadcn initialization command
- Provide instructions for adding components
- Return to the root directory

### Option 2: Manual setup

If you prefer to set up shadcn UI manually:

1. Navigate to your Next.js application directory:
   ```
   cd my-app
   ```

2. Run the shadcn initialization command:
   ```
   npx shadcn@latest init
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to configure shadcn UI.

4. After initialization, you can add components using:
   ```
   npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
   ```
   For example: `npx shadcn@latest add button`
